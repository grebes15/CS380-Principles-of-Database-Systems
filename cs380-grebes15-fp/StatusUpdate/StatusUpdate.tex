For this final project, I decided to focus on XML Applications with DOM and SAX. So far, I was able to use the program DOMEcho.java given by Professor Kapfhammer in a version control repository. By studying the source code in a file of DOMEcho.java, I was able to modify the source code to be able to delete the command line arguments that were not necessary to use for the purposes I set out to have when completing this final project. I was also able to implement SAXecho.java program to be able to parse any XML file using Simple API XML. I was able to successfully implement this two programs and now I was able to find different XML files of different sizes to be tested to see which of the two programs that I have modified and implemented has better performance. I was successful in finding an XML file that was over 200mb that I will be testing to see which of the two programs has the better performance.
