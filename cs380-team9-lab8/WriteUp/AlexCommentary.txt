This lab seemed to progress fairly well overall, and I feel both partners did well in operating as a team and smoothly completing this assignment. We essentially just divided up the jobs as we saw fit and got to work. Andreas wrote out the DOM description. We both gave our own customizations to staff.xml, and I recorded the output from the original XML files.

We initially worked together on the main force of the lab, extending DOMEcho. I saw the basic idea of adjusting the command line argument, but Andreas was ultimately the one to actually implement the solution. Once the program was complete, I took to Google in order to find more example XML files with which to test the program. Using his code updates, I was able to test XML files of varying complexity with no difficulties. I then compiled the report of DOM-based XML performance trade-offs by utilizing our program's results. Being the one to have prior knowledge of Latex, Andreas finished the lab by bringing our deliverables together into a single lab report. Overall, we both accomplished a fair portion of the work and, more to the point, both came out of the lab understanding all concepts fully.
